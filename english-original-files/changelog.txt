"Sunset" Update
>Full of QoL improvements and bug fixes!

>   QoL Improvements / Features
<->Super Dog Mutator: Due to our undeniable fondness of them, we've added a new mutator based on the Super Guard mutator which will help give our furry friends an upgrade.
<->Capacitor 2.0: I introduce to you, the Capacitor Max Plus - an upgraded version of the capacitor which allows your Power Stations to now produce twice the amount of power than they did before.
<->Remote Doors: We have added a coloured variant of the remote doors for both Death Row and Supermax security levels.
<->Riot Van Speed: Due to the efficiency of air-bound emergency units we have increased the movement speed of the Riot Guard Vans, to lower their arrival time. 
<->Updated Descriptions: After sweeping through the game we decided to update or add a number of new text strings. As such we've updated text for Item descriptions, Staff descriptions, and also Need descriptions.

<->With this update we have focused on improving the player experience as much as possible. 
We thank you all for playing Prison Architect.
