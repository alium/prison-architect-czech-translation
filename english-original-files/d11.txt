insane_letter									Dear Sir/Madam,\n\n\nHere’s some important guidelines to ensure you are prepared with the appropriate facilities and staff in order to take proper care of Criminally Insane inmates.\n\n1.  Criminally Insane inmates must have Padded Cells. You can transform standard cells into padded cells (via the Rooms menu). Once you have padded cells you’ll be able to accept your first batch of inmates.\n\n2.  Make sure you have Psychiatrists and Orderly staff members on your payroll. Psychiatrists will also require a special office.\n\n3.  Set up some Psychiatric Consultation programs for your Criminally Insane inmates. These one to one sessions with a Psychiatrist (and padded cells), help to keep the inmates under control. Upgrading the Psychiatrist’s office will also improve their treatment ability.\n\n4.  Left untreated and unchecked, a Criminally Insane inmate may exhibit unpredictable behaviours, attempt to break out, or turn violent.\n\n5.  Orderlies will help escort and heal, and they do not suppress inmates like regular guards. You’ll also need Orderlies to fit your Psychopathic Criminally Insane Inmates with straitjackets at the day’s end. \n\n6.  Criminally Insane inmates mixing with others can sometimes lead to trouble. It's a good idea to build and segregate Criminally Insane sectors to Canteens, Yards and other areas. And you may wish to have the Psychiatrist’s offices near your Criminally Insane cell blocks.\n\n7.  Finally, inmates from other security levels now have a chance to become criminally insane, so keep an eye out\n\nThe CEO,\nPrison Architects Corp

codex_tooltip_prisonerTransfer			Prisoner Transfers allows you to set criteria that inmates must meet in order to be transferred and upgraded into a nicer security sector within your prison, one that may offer more comfort, facilities and other privileges. \n\nInmates will now evaluate their current sector’s conditions and those of the sector below their’s, and decide if they like to be transferred. If so, they will then determine whether they will try to improve their behaviour and meet your transfer policy, based on their own needs and characteristics.\n\nEach sector is graded, based on the privileges and facilities you offer to inmates in that sector. The bigger the ‘difference’ between their sector and the one below, the more prisoners will want to be transferred overall.\n\nAfter a prisoner meets your transfer criteria, it's still up to you whether and when to transfer them.

objective_ReadSandALetter						Letter from the CEO (Island Bound)
island_letter									Dear Sir/Madam,\n\n\nWelcome to your new life as an Island Bound Prison Architect! Here’s some tips to get you started with docks, helipads and island prisons.\n\n1. Islands - Depending on the prison's circumstances, you may have no physical link to the mainland, and if so you will need BOATS and HELICOPTERS to provide your transportation services. Build Boat DOCKS and HELIPADS, and determine their purposes; to receive specific deliveries, new prisoners, or new emergencies units and more, by sea and air. -Make sure docks are built with a clear shipping lane for boats to come and go. -Special FERRY DOCKS can be built to link islands together, as well as BRIDGES and STEPPING STONES. -Your prison can now be better protected with new ELITE OPS units, and helicopters that can fight fires from the air.\n\n2. Customising Deliveries and Transports - Via LOGISTICS, you can customise which services are assigned to each dock, helipad and the road, allowing your prison's efficiency to increase. Docks and Helipads can be linked to additional Delivery, Reception and Export zones. This will allow you to have food supplies delivered closer to the Kitchen, or new Max Sec inmates brought in closer to the Max Sec wing on your island, for example. The possibilities are endless!\n\n3. Landscaping - Water can be placed to create moats or oceans around your prison, and land can be shaped with shorelines, using dirt and other flooring types. Any land or smaller islands created in water, will be created immediately.\n\n4. New Security Measures - Contraband can still arrive via boats and helicopters, so we’re also providing you with some new state-of-the-art equipment; -Build SCANNER MACHINES in Delivery and Storage areas to check crates and boxes. You’ll need an alert guard to watch on a connected SCANNER MONITOR. -Assign guards to CHECKPOINTS to pat-down all prisoners and visitors passing through. This is a great way to discover contraband, but can reduce the flow of prisoners if not placed strategically.\n\nFinally, even islands aren’t escape-proof, so it could be a good idea to erect Sniper Towers on your shorelines, to keep an eye out for ‘swimmers’.\n\nThat's about everything - good luck!\n\nThe CEO,\nPrison Architects Corp.

buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_1       The Room Quality view shows you the quality rating of all upgrade-able rooms in your prison. The higher the number, the better the quality. Mousing over a room will show you the factors that went into determining it's quality, and what you can add to increase that quality.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_2		With PRISONER TRANSFERS turned ON
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_3		- Room quality will also contribute to an overall grade for that Security Sector. 
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_4		- Prisoners will desire to be transferred to a lower Security Sector, if it is better (has a higher grade) than their current Security Sector.\n\n
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_5       CELL GRADING
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_6       - Prisoners are entitled to a higher quality cell for good behaviour over time. Having higher quality cells available is a good way to incentivise good behaviour.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_7       - It's important to keep some low quality cells in your prison, as new arrivals to your prison will need somewhere to go, and if all the available cells are too high quality they might find themselves in a holding cell.
buildtoolbar_popup_help_roomquality_8       - Prisoners can be placed in a higher quality cell than they deserve if there is no other space available, but it might make the other prisoners unhappy...

d11_staffalert_details_CELLS01Z				We have *A free *B cells.
d11_staffalert_hint_MONEY01					The prison is running out of money, may I suggest we take in more prisoners to increase our daily income or meet the conditions for a new grant for a large cash injection.
d11_staffalert_hint_PRISONERS02				It's not safe for your guards to be so heavily outnumbered by the prisoners, each guard can safely manage around 5 prisoners.
d11_staffalert_hint_CONTRABAND03			Check the contraband intelligence report I filed to locate the sources of contraband over the last 7 days and enact measures to close them off.
d11_staffalert_hint_CONTRABAND02			Prisoners have easy access to narcotics, which is very dangerous. Hire Dog Handlers and have them patrol the cell blocks or order a prison-wide Shakedown.
d11_staffalert_hint_CONTRABAND01			Prisoners have easy access to tools and weapons, which is very dangerous. Place metal detectors near the sources of contraband or order a prison-wide Shakedown.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS04					Prisoners will get hungry over time, make sure there is enough room in the canteen and enough time allocated for eating so that everyone can be fed.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS03					Prisoners need to sleep to stay happy. They will do this during the allocated Sleep periods or during Free Time.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS01					Prisoners need access to toilets, consider adding more toilets to your prison or increasing your allocation of Free Time.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS02					Prisoners need access to toilets, consider adding more toilets to your prison or increasing your allocation of Free Time.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS08					Hygiene is important in every day life, in prison it's essential. Make sure your prisoners have plenty of time to catch a shower.
d11_staffalert_hint_OBJECTS04				Our guards currently have to spend most of their time opening jail doors for people, their time is too important for this! Install a Door Control system and one guard can open multiple doors remotely.
d11_staffalert_hint_ROOMS01					All rooms have certain requirements which you must meet, highlight rooms with flashing red exclamation mark icons to see which requirements you are not meeting.
d11_staffalert_hint_INFORMANTS01			Our Informant will not last long in here without our protection, I suggest changing their security level to 'Protective Custody' and moving them out of general population.
d11_staffalert_hint_HOLDINGCELL01			It's too dangerous to leave this many prisoners in the Holding Cells long-term. You must build more Cells to house them as soon as possible or they may start a riot!
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS06					The prison is very dirty and it is making your inmates very unhappy, find a way to clean up as quickly as you can before they become angry.

d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS13					Prisoners all want one thing. To not be in prison. While we can't give them that, we can make their stay more pleasant with plenty of Free Time.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS09					Exercise keeps your prisoners fit, healthy and happy. Make sure they have easy access to weight benches.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS10					Help break up the day to day monotony by giving your prisoners access to recreational items such as Pool Tables, Radios and TV's.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS11					Downtime is important for everyone, but in prison, it can be hard to find. Giving your prisoners benches and sofas to sit on will help them to relax.
d11_staffalert_hint_POWER01					Certain objects need to be connected to a Power Station to work, use electrical cables to connect all objects with a flashing lightning bolt icon on them to a Power Station.
d11_staffalert_hint_WATER01					Certain objects need to be connected to a water pump to work, use water pipes to connect all objects with a flashing water drop icon on them to a water pump.
d11_staffalert_hint_CELLS01					Taking in more prisoners gives us a nice up front cash bonus, it also means we get more money from the state every day. We should always run at full capacity if possible!
d11_staffalert_hint_OBJECTS03				CCTV Cameras allow us to monitor areas of the prison even when no Guards are in the area. A single CCTV Monitor allows one Guard to view 8 different CCTV Cameras. They're a no brainer!
d11_staffalert_hint_OBJECTS01				At the moment we are seriously unequipped to deal with a fire in the prison. We should install a sprinkler system as soon as possible.
d11_staffalert_hint_POWER02					Our Power Station is seriously overloaded, add more capacitors to it or build a new one to share the load. Be careful though, Power Stations can't be connected together!
d11_staffalert_hint_DEATHROW01				Adding a Death Row to the Prison is risky as the execution needs to be handled very carefully so we meet all of the legal requirements... But, we could make lot of money, so it may be worth the risk!
d11_staffalert_hint_STAFF01					Your staff can't work effectively if they are exhausted, build them a staffroom so that they can relax or hire more staff as cover to ease the burden on them.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS12					Sometimes, prisoners just need some alone time, however “it's not you, it's me” doesn't tend to go down too well in prisons. Make sure prisoners have access to their own cell.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS19					A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, the man who never reads lives only one. Let your prisoners 'escape' into a good book by giving them access to a library.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS05					Prisoners can become angry if they are not allowed to communicate with their families. Build a Visitation Room, a Mail Room or Phone Booths to hold off the prison blues.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS07					If the danger level of your prison is too high many prisoners will start to feel unsafe and scared. Lower your danger level by catering to your prisoners other needs.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS15					Some inmates enter the prison with drug habits. If they can't get over their addiction they start to get angry, or they may start to deal in contraband to get their fix. Use reform programs to help their recovery.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS16					Some inmates enter the prison with an addiction to alcohol. If they can't get over their addiction they start to get angry, or they may start to deal in contraband to get their fix. Use reform programs to help their recovery.
d11_staffalert_hint_NEEDS18					Attending spiritual guidance programs will have a calming effect on your prisoners, they will also spread this calm to other prisoners.
d11_staffalert_hint_PRISONERS03				All of our prisoners are entitled to a cell of a certain level of quality based on their behaviour. Improve the quality of a cell using the Logistics screen.
d11_staffalert_hint_DOCTOR01				We can't treat anyone in the Infirmary unless you hire some Doctors. Doctors can use the infirmary to treat any injuries that occur to staff or prisoners.
d11_staffalert_hint_OBJECTS02				Bins allow us to store lots of rubbish before they need emptying, this means much fewer trips to the garbage area. Add bins to the kitchen and place them near metal detectors to increase efficiency.

objective_HelpBasicFarming				Basic Farming
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_1			Farming Rooms
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_1_Description		There are 4 new rooms associated with farming, the Vegetable Allotment, Farming Field, Fruit Orchard, and the Pantry. \n\nThe first 3 rooms are required for the planting of Vegetables, Cereals, and Fruit Trees respectively whilst the Pantry room is a cold storage room for harvested crops. \n\nEach of the 3 main farming rooms must be placed outdoors and will require a shed object which is used as a water source for manual crop watering and as a storage area for seeds and similar items.
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_2			Planting Crops
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_2_Description		To plant crops, farming rooms must first be created and Farmers must be hired to manage jobs related to these crops. \n\nCrops can only be grown in their specific rooms and can only grow on the following flooring types: “Dirt”, “Mud”, “Grass”, “Grass Corner”, or “Flowery Field”. \n\nAfter their initial cycle of growth and harvesting, replacing these crops can be automated via the "Continuous Planting" policy \n\nIf you wish to replace these crops with a different type please make sure that this policy has been disabled.
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_3			Crop Traits
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_3_Description		Each of the 3 main crop types have different traits, both Cereals and Vegetables only have a single yield and must be replanted after each harvest but fruit trees will continuously yield fruit \n\nAll 3 crop types can be sold as exports but only fruit and vegetables can be used for meals.
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_4			Crop Benefits
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_4_Description		The main benefit of using prison-grown ingredients instead of the standard ingredients, that are usually delivered, are the effects they have when consumed. \n\nInmates who eat fresh ingredients will receive a higher effect to their hunger need, whilst other needs  also gain minor boosts \n\nInmates eating an entire course of fresh ingredients will also have the chance of gaining the new "Healthy" status, which has a similar effect to inmates completing the alcohol and drug therapy sessions.
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_5			Ingredient Storage
objective_HelpBasicFarming_child_5_Description	 	Unlike standard ingredients, crops grown within the prison do not have preservatives to prevent them from spoiling. \n\nAs such, after harvest, crops will need to be moved to either a refrigerated item or to the pantry room which is always refrigerated \n\nOtherwise over the course of 3 days, they will expire and both the effects they have when consumed and their export price will be lowered. 

objective_HelpAdvancedFarming				Advanced Farming
objective_HelpAdvancedFarming_child_1			Farming Research
objective_HelpAdvancedFarming_child_1_Description	Not all farming related items will be available from the start of a new game. \nThe bureaucracy research task "Farming" must first be completed to gain access to all:\n\n-More crops\n-The Crop distribution logistics option\n-Compost Fertilizer, High Quality fertilizer, & Compost Bin \n-Prisoner Labour \n-Automatic Watering, Harvesting, & Gathering Item
objective_HelpAdvancedFarming_child_2			Crop distribution
objective_HelpAdvancedFarming_child_2_Description	This new logistics option allows players to select where crops are moved to after harvest, and the ratio of that distribution. \n\nPlayers can also choose the links between pantries and kitchens, though without using this action links will automatically be created based on distance.

objective_HelpAdvancedFarming_child_3			Fertilizer
objective_HelpAdvancedFarming_child_3_Description	There are two fertilizer items, Compost Fertilizer and High Quality Fertilizer, that can both be used to improve your crop growth speed of crops and also the chance for seeds to be produced upon harvest. \n\nHigh Quality fertilzer has higher effects than the compost version, but is more expensive whereas the compost alternative is both cheaper and can be produced yourself by using the Compost Bin item; via plant and food waste items.

objective_HelpAdvancedFarming_child_4			Automated Farming
objective_HelpAdvancedFarming_child_4_Description	There are 3 farming jobs that can be automated using items, these jobs are watering crops, harvesting crops, and gathering these harvested crops.


objective_HelpGreenEnergy 				Green Energy

objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_1 			Green energy types
objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_1_description		There are three new green power sources, that can be used to replace the Power Station. \n\nWind Turbines \nSolar Panels \nSolar-powered Wind Turbines \nOnly solar panels will be available initially. \n\nEach green energy source have slightly different properties including their power output, but unlike Power Stations they can be connected to one another into a large array; though Transformers do have a limit on power input. 

objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_2 			Weather effects
objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_2_description		Each power source can have their power production be either negatively or positively effected by weather types. \n\nThese effects will be indicated by a +/- graphic and also a tooltip when cursoring over these energy sources. \n\nAs an example, the solar panel is positively affected by both the Clear and Heatwave weather types, \nbut negatively affected by the overcast, rain, torrential rain, and the frost weather types. 

objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_3 			Transformers & Batteries
objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_3_description		Due to the properties of raw green energy, each new energy source must be connected to a transformer item via electrical cables before their power can be used for electrical appliances. \n\nThe Transformer itself not only transforms raw green energy into a usable form of energy, but it can also charge any adjacent battery items. \n\nThe energy stored within Battery items can be used as emergency power as well as a new export via the Power Export Meter.

objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_4 			Power Export
objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_4_description		The Power Export Meter can be connected to a transformer through wiring, if this trasformer has batteries attached then any power stored within can be sold as a limitted export every day. \n\nThis export limit can be increased by completing a certain green energy goals.

objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_5 			Green energy goals
objective_HelpGreenEnergy_child_5_description		A number of targets for green energy can be found within the Grant menu, by completing these objectives rewards will be gained including: \n\n- Raising the daily limit of power export \n- Unlocking additional energy sources \n- Increasing the performance of any purchased green energy sources.

objective_HelpNarcoticProduction 			Narcotic Production

objective_HelpNarcoticProduction_child_1 		Booze Production	
objective_HelpNarcoticProduction_child_1_description	Prisoners who meet certain conditions are able to brew their own booze. \n\nFirst they will retrieve ingredients for brewing from farming rooms, kitchen areas, or any vending machine they have access to. \n\nThey will then prepare these ingredients at night within their cells before stashing the brewing booze for a number of days to ferment.  

objective_HelpNarcoticProduction_child_2		Drug Production
objective_HelpNarcoticProduction_child_2_description 	Drug production on the other hand will only be based within a single room, the Farming Field - inmates will attempt to tamper with existing crops to hide growable drugs. \n\nThese tampered plants will have the smelly trait and as such can be detected by guard dogs, but these areas will never be counted within shakedowns and as such manual search order must be given - though each search will have a chance to damage crops. \n\nWhen these crops are harvested the narcotics will also be retrieved, if the correct inmate does the harvesting . \n\nGangs are also able to take control of Farming Field rooms to guarantee that they control the production of narcotics.

reformProgram_ConflictResolution		Conflict Resolution
reformProgram_ConflictResolution_text	An ex-inmate who has now reformed will come in to speak about the possible difficulties found upon release. Different problematic scenarios will be roleplayed for inmates to learn how to avoid resorting to violence.

reformProgram_ReformedPrisonerConsultation				Reformed Prisoner Consultation
reformProgram_ReformedPrisonerConsultation_text			The idea of this program is to change the mindset of the currently incarcerated, by having an ex-inmate who has now reformed to speak about their experiences and new life.

reformProgram_juvenilecorrection						Three Strikes Program
reformProgram_juvenilecorrection_text					Allowing inmates and civilian "delinquents" to interact should have a positive effect on both, as long as inmates have either been trained or have the correct level of customer service experience to interact with these "delinquents".

reformProgram_socialtraining							Three Strikes Training
reformProgram_socialtraining_text						Allowing inmates to interact with civilians that have no relation to them can be a worry for many, as such this program teaches which actions are and are not okay; whilst also increasing an inmate's customer service experience.

reformProgram_RehabilitatedPrisoner_text	This former prisoner has reformed into a model citizen and along with their current occupation they have taken it upon themselves to use their time to help others who are struggling to reform, as a prison consultant.

# Work Experience

objective_WorkExperience							Work Experience

objective_WorkExperience_child_1					Introduction to Work Experience
objective_WorkExperience_child_1_Description		Prisoners will now have work experience recorded, this can help them in reforming into model citizens and can also aid them in prison. For example, after gaining experience in a specific field prisoners will perform jobs associated with that field of work more efficiently than they would previously. Prisoners with 50% in Cooking, Craftmanship, or Customer Service can work any related jobs without completing the associated training. Prisoners will also achieve points toward their reoffending rate when reaching 50% and 100% experience in any field of work.   

objective_WorkExperience_child_2					How to Gain Work Experience
objective_WorkExperience_child_2_Description		There are 3 ways in which inmates can gain work experience: \n\nPre-existing Work Credentials - Prisoners up to the Maximum security level can possess work experience due to their previous occupations. \n\nTraining Programs - Inmates who complete 1 of the 3 training programs (Workshop Safety, Kitchen safety or Three Strikes Training) will gain 50% of the experience required in their respective field (Cooking, Craftsman or Customer Service respectively). \n\nPrison Labour - Any inmate taking part in labour jobs will gain experience in the relevant field every hour.

# New Rooms

objective_NewRooms									New Rooms

objective_NewRooms_child_2							New Rooms - Compatible Inmates
objective_NewRooms_child_2_Description				Inmates that possess the required experience in Customer Service or cooking will be able to work inside either the Bakery or Restaurant. The required experience level for both fields is 50%, which can be achieved by prisoners completing the appropriate training program.

objective_NewRooms_child_3							New Rooms - Managing these rooms
objective_NewRooms_child_3_Description				Labour Management is a sub menu within the Prison Labour Logistics. \n\nUsing this sub menu allows players to set the work hours for the room, along with the security level of the inmates permitted to work on the premises, the quality and speed of production and the number of guards deployed to the room. With the potential to have a substantial number of prisoners and civilians present, there is a chance that prisoners could turn violent in certain situations.

objective_NewRooms_child_9							The Restaurant Room - Customer Satisfaction
objective_NewRooms_child_9_Description				The number of customers that arrive is based on the prior group's satisfaction. Customers who don't get served will have low satisfaction, low quality meals will give a medium level of satisfaction, and high quality meals will give customers high satisfaction.

# Juvenile Correction Program

objective_ScaredStraight							Three Strikes Program

objective_ScaredStraight_child_1					How the Program Works
objective_ScaredStraight_child_1_Description		The program invites civilians on their final warning with the law, into the prison to learn directly from inmates about the realities of prison life. Inmates must pass the training program before they are allowed to share their knowledge with civilian groups. As Three Strikes is a social program, any inmates who already possess the required experience in ‘Customer Service’ will be able to take part in the program without the need for training. A Guard will oversee the smooth and orderly running of the group sessions.

objective_ScaredStraight_child_3					Benefits of Completing the Program
objective_ScaredStraight_child_3_Description		Inmates will receive a small boost to their Reoffending Rate and the appropriate increase to their Work Experience for successful completion of the program. In addition, inmates will also see a reduction to their boiling point, and also receive a bonus to their Family and/or Freedom needs.

# Behavioural Programs

objective_BehaviouralPrograms						New Behavioural Programs

This program is tutored by former prisoners, allowing for a more open and constructive session. The program is split over multiple sessions. On successful completion, the prisoners will: see a reduction  in their boiling point as well as the chance of removing any violence based Reputation.

objective_BehaviouralPrograms_child_3				Former Prisoner Consultation
objective_BehaviouralPrograms_child_3_Description	Former prisoners who have successfully reformed upon leaving prison are invited back to guest speak to the currently incarcerated. Prisoners have a greater appreciation when words are delivered from 'one of their own' and are more willing to be open and share their thoughts with a teacher who has been in the same position. \n\nThe program is split over multiple sessions. On successful completion, the prisoners will: see a reduction in their reoffending rate, improve or reduce specific Needs such as Family, Freedom and Safety as well as the chance of removing any negative behavioural Reputation.

# Sentence Reductions

objective_SentenceReductions						Sentence Reductions & Extensions

objective_SentenceReductions_child_1				Adding & Reducing Time to Prisoner Sentences via their Behaviour
objective_SentenceReductions_child_1_Description	A prisoner's behaviour can directly influence the duration of their remaining sentence. \n\n Behaviour Criteria, Criteria value and Sentence Reduction parameters can all be modified in the Sentence Adjustments menu. By adhering to the criteria set for Good Behaviour, the prisoner will be rewarded with a reduction to their sentence. \n\nPrisoners who do not adhere to the set criteria and cause Misconduct may face an increase to their current sentence. Whilst minor infractions will escape punishment, serious crimes will cause an extension to the duration of a prisoner's sentence.

# Released Prisoners

objective_ReleasedPrisoners				Released Prisoners

objective_ReleasedPrisoners_child_1				Reward & Punishments for Reforming & Re-offence 
objective_ReleasedPrisoners_child_1_Description			Released prisoners will either start a new life or fall back into old habits and return to prison. \n\nFor every prisoner that successfully reforms, a cash bonus will be paid. \n\nFor every prisoner that reoffends and returns to the prison, a fine will be issued for their failed rehabilitation.

objective_ReleasedPrisoners_child_2			Returning Prisoners
objective_ReleasedPrisoners_child_2_Description			Freed prisoners who reoffend and are returned to the prison may pick up additional bad habits whilst on the outside. \n\nPrisoners could return with either an additional reputation or an upgrade to an existing reputation - such as being ‘Strong’ on release and ‘Extremely Strong’ upon their return. These prisoners can be spotted by an icon above their head, and can also be found via a notification within the Released Prisoners menu.

# Prison Labour Wages

objective_LabourWages 			Prison Labour Wages

objective_LabourWages_child_1				Adjusting Labour Wages and the Effects  
objective_LabourWages_child_1_Description				Each labour job worked pays the prisoner an hourly wage.Wages can be tailored to each labour type via the finance menu. Higher wages motivate inmates to take part in prison labour and work related programs.\n Increasing the wage for kitchen will increase interest in the hygiene program, wage increase for Bakeries and Restaurants increase interest in the Hygiene program and three strikes training, whereas increasing the wages for the Workshop and Library jobs will increase interest for the Safety and education programs respectively.    


# Prisoner Grant Bonus

objective_PrisonerGrantBonus 		Prisoner Grant Bonus

objective_PrisonerGrantBonus_child_1			Benefits of Low Reoffending Rates 
objective_PrisonerGrantBonus_child_1_Description			Prisons that have a successful rehabilitation program will have their low offending rates acknowledged by way of an increase to the value paid per prisoner each day. The lower the rate, the higher the daily bonus.\nThis additional income can be found in the Finance Menu under the name Prisoner Grant Bonus.

objective_PrisonerGrantBonus_child_2			Specific Payments 
objective_PrisonerGrantBonus_child_2_Description			Daily payments will be provided depending on prisoner security levels and whether these prisoners have reoffending rates lower than 30%, 20%, and 10%.

event_rollingblackout					The Storms are playing havoc with the local power grid. The installation of backup generators are a good failsafe. We must try to keep power running to the prison even in emergency situations.
event_frozenpeople_cold                 I don't think anyone should be outside in this cold. We should get everyone inside otherwise we might have a death on our hands.
event_frozenpeople_die                  Someone has frozen to death outside. This is a tragedy that should have been avoided. It is your responsibility to manage the welfare of the prisoners and staff within these walls. Nobody should be outside in these conditions.
event_frozensmallpipe_frozenvalve       Sections of the pipework are frozen solid. If they don't have any insulation they're likely to freeze a lot quicker when the temperature drops.
event_damage_cable_advisor				It seems like we've got some faulty wiring. Installing heavy duty cables would be a good idea, but anyone with the proper training can fix them.
event_rat_droppings_advisor				I've just seen a rat... perhaps we should think about investing in some form of deterrent?
event_rat_stealFood_advisor				I've just seen a rat scurrying about with some food. They must be raiding the kitchens...
event_rat_chewFence_advisor				A routine inspection has uncovered that rats are chewing holes in fences. It goes without saying that this poses a potential security risk
event_rat_illnessWarning_advisor		The rat problem is now an infestation. If their numbers aren't reduced, it's only a matter of time before they pass on disease to the prisoners.
event_rat_illnessOutbreak_advisor		It looks like a few prisoners are suffering from illness due to the presence of rats. We should look at treating the infected and I recommend a thorough clean, especially kitchens or food preparation areas.
event_rat_escapeTunnels_advisor			There are rumours coming from the block that inmates are observing the rats to find areas that might be easier to tunnel.

event_deepfreeze_flu_outbreak			There are reports that a few prisoners may have the flu, action may need to be taken to keep it under control!
event_deepfreeze_flu_onboarding			The cold weather brings with it the risk of prisoners catching seasonal Flu. It's important to try and keep infected prisoners separated from the rest of the prison population and, if possible, to direct them to the infirmary for treatment.

event_deepfreeze_construction_onboarding		The conditions outside are difficult. With the ground being frozen, the speed of construction is going to slow down.
event_deepfreeze_gardening_onboarding			The ground is frozen solid, it's difficult to plant anything right now.
event_deepfreeze_frozentunnel_onboarding		The only good thing about this weather is that it's going to slow down anyone planning to dig their way out of here.
event_deepfreeze_frozenpump_onboarding			A frozen Water Pump is blocking the flow of water. Without any insulation, items are more likely to freeze when the temperature drops.
event_pipe_burst_onboarding						There's substantial flooding due to a burst pipe. I can't see this subsiding any time, soon unless you call someone in to pump the water out. 
event_heatwave_meltingroad_onboarding			The Roads are getting dangerous. Any vehicles passing the prison are going to have to travel much slower until conditions improve. It may be advisable to hire emergency maintenance to improve the situation.
event_deepfreeze_sprinklers				In such cold conditions the prison's sprinklers may freeze, putting lives at risk. Make sure you have personnel with adequate fire training in the event of such a scenario. A poor Fire Safety record won't do the prison's reputation any favours.
event_deepfreeze_road					The Roads are getting dangerous. Any vehicles passing by the prison are going to have to travel much slower until conditions improve. It may be advisable to hire emergency maintenance to improve the situation.
event_heatwave_heatstroke				This intense heat can have dangerous effects on people, such as causing heatstroke. We'll have to make sure that everyone is kept hydrated and have medical staff on standby.

fallen_tree_advisor			Where did these trees come from? The winds must be stronger than we thought. Deliveries are slow to get through, perhaps we should send some workers over to remove the fallen debris.

lightning_strike_advisor	The most dangerous thing about a storm is the lightning, with both objects and people at danger of being struck. Lightning rods will be able to redirect lightning to a degree so make sure you purchase some to help protect your prison and its people.
frozen_ground_advisor		It's getting pretty icy on the footpaths outside, janitors should be able to lay grit down when properly trained.
heatwave_fire_advisor		With this heatwave we have to be careful with any plants or wood materials laying outside. If any fire breaks out we must contain it immediately.
deep_freeze_frozen_shower_head		Shower heads freeze very easily and there's not much we can do to stop it from happening. Hopefully the showers that are still in good working order will suffice.	
deep_freeze_frozen_sprinkler		In such cold conditions the prison's sprinklers may freeze, putting lives at risk. Make sure you have personnel with adequate fire training in the event of such a scenario. A poor Fire Safety record won't do the prison's reputation any favours.
